# Servlet Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal learning space for Java Servlets, the foundation of Java web development. This repo is where I’m storing my notes and simple code examples as I learn the basics of server-side programming. It’s a reference for future me to revisit and track my progress.

## What I’m Learning
This repository covers fundamental Servlet topics to build a strong base, especially as they relate to frameworks like Spring Boot:

- **Servlet Basics**: Understanding what Servlets are, their lifecycle (init, service, destroy), and methods like `doGet()` and `doPost()`.
- **HTTP Request & Response**: Working with `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` for handling client data and server output.
- **Servlet Threading**: Learning the multi-threaded nature of Servlets and thread-safety concerns.
- **Session Management**: Basics of HTTP sessions and cookies for user state.
- **Filters**: Exploring how Filters intercept requests for tasks like logging or authentication.

## Purpose
This is my personal log to document my journey with Servlets. I’ll add code snippets and explanations as I go, making it easy for me to review key concepts later. It’s all about building a solid foundation for web development in Java.

## Getting Started
If I revisit this, I can clone the repo and run the examples in an IDE with an embedded server like Tomcat. Check the code folders for specific topics and notes.
