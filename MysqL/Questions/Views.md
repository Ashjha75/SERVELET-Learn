## üßæ What is a SQL View?

A **SQL View** is a virtual table that represents the result of a stored query. It does not store data physically but provides a way to simplify complex queries, enhance security, and present data in a customized format. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Characteristics of Views

* **Virtual Table**: Behaves like a table but does not store data physically.
* **Simplifies Complex Queries**: Encapsulates complex joins and conditions into a single object.
* **Enhances Security**: Restricts access to specific columns or rows.
* **Customizes Data Presentation**: Provides tailored data views for different users.
* **Dynamic Data Retrieval**: Reflects the current data from the underlying tables each time it's accessed.([GeeksforGeeks][1])

## üß± Types of Views

1. **Simple View**: Based on a single table without any group functions.
2. **Complex View**: Based on multiple tables and can include group functions.
3. **Materialized View**: Stores the result of the query physically and needs to be refreshed to reflect changes in the underlying tables. ([Wikipedia][2])

---

## üßæ Creating a View

**Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example**: Creating a view to list active users.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveUsers AS
SELECT id, name, email
FROM Users
WHERE status = 'active';
```



---

## üîÑ Updating a View

Views can be updated if they are based on a single table and do not include group functions or DISTINCT.

**Syntax**:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```



---

## ‚ùå Dropping a View

**Syntax**:

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```



---

## üîê Security and Permissions

Views can be used to restrict access to specific data. By granting permissions on the view and not on the underlying tables, users can access only the data exposed by the view.([Microsoft Learn][3])

---

## üìå Use Cases in Your Schema

* **Simplify Complex Joins**: Create views that join `Users`, `Posts`, and `Comments` to present user activity.
* **Restrict Sensitive Data**: Expose only necessary columns from the `Users` table to certain roles.
* **Aggregate Data**: Use views to present summarized order information from `Orders` and `Order_Items`.

# üßæ SQL Interview Questions: Views

---

## üîπ Basic View Creation

1. **Create a view named `ActiveUsers` that lists all users with an 'active' status.**

2. **Design a view `UserPosts` that displays each user's name along with the titles of their posts.**

3. **Construct a view `PostComments` showing post titles and the count of comments each has received.**

---

## üîπ Views with Joins and Aggregations

4. **Develop a view `UserOrderSummary` that presents each user's name, total number of orders, and total amount spent.**

5. **Create a view `ProductSales` that lists each product's name, total units sold, and total revenue generated.**

6. **Design a view `CategoryProductCount` showing each category and the number of products it contains.**

---

## üîπ Updatable Views and Limitations

7. **Is it possible to update the `ActiveUsers` view directly to change a user's status? Explain why or why not.**

8. **Attempt to insert a new record into the `UserPosts` view. What challenges might arise, and how can they be addressed?**

9. **Modify the `PostComments` view to include only posts with more than 5 comments. Discuss the implications for updatability.**

---

## üîπ Nested and Complex Views

10. **Create a view `TopCustomers` that lists users who have placed more than 10 orders.**

11. **Design a view `RecentOrders` that shows orders placed in the last 30 days, including user names and order totals.**

12. **Construct a view `HighValueOrders` that lists orders with totals exceeding $1000, along with user and product details.**

---

## üîπ Security and Access Control

13. **How can views be utilized to restrict access to sensitive user information, such as email addresses?**

14. **Design a view `PublicPosts` that exposes only post titles and publication dates, hiding user information.**

15. **Explain how to grant SELECT permissions on the `PublicPosts` view without granting access to the underlying `Posts` table.**

---

## üîπ Maintenance and Optimization

16. **What are the steps to update the definition of the `UserOrderSummary` view to include average order value?**

17. **Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using materialized views for the `ProductSales` view in a high-traffic database.**

18. **How can indexing be applied to views to improve query performance, and what are the limitations?**

---

## üîπ Advanced Scenarios

19. **Create a view `UserActivity` that combines data from `Users`, `Posts`, and `Comments` to show overall user engagement.**

20. **Design a view `InactiveUsers` that lists users who haven't posted or commented in the last 6 months.**
