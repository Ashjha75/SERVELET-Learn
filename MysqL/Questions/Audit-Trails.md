# üìù Audit Trails in SQL Databases: Notes & Key Questions

## üìå What is an Audit Trail?

An **audit trail** (or audit log) is a chronological record of database activities, capturing:

- **Who** performed the action
- **What** was changed
- **When** the change occurred
- **Why** the change was made (optional, often captured via comments or application logs)

Audit trails are essential for:

- **Security**: Detecting unauthorized access or changes
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data consistency and traceability
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing issues and understanding system behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementing Audit Trails

### 1. **Schema Design**

- **Audit Table**: Create a dedicated table to log changes. A typical structure includes:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE AuditLog (
      AuditID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      TableName VARCHAR(255),
      RecordID INT,
      Operation CHAR(1), -- 'I' = Insert, 'U' = Update, 'D' = Delete
      OldValue TEXT,
      NewValue TEXT,
      ChangedBy VARCHAR(255),
      ChangedAt DATETIME
  );
````

* **Trigger-Based Logging**: Use database triggers to automatically insert records into the audit table upon data modifications.

  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trg_Audit_Orders
  ON Orders
  FOR INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  AS
  BEGIN
      -- Insert audit log entry
  END;
  ```



### 2. **Best Practices**

* **Minimal Performance Impact**: Ensure that auditing does not significantly degrade system performance.

* **Data Retention Policies**: Define how long audit logs should be retained and implement archiving strategies.

* **Access Controls**: Restrict access to audit logs to authorized personnel only.

* **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review audit logs to detect any unauthorized or suspicious activities.



* **Comprehensive Coverage**: Audit all critical tables and operations, including schema changes and permission modifications.
